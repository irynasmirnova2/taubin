                    Ostrogozhsk
                    Julij Taŭbin was born in Ostrogozhsk on September 15(2), 1911 in the family of a pharmacist. Most likely, his surname comes from the Yiddish word &quot;taube&quot; (a dove). The poet&apos;s father, who belonged to the Socialist-Revolutionary Party, disappeared in the early days of the revolution, and the poet hardly remembered him. Julij Taŭbin had a brother, Illa Taŭbin.

                        Mśćisłaŭ
                        In 1921 the poet&apos;s family moved to Mśćisłaŭ. Julij Taŭbin started publishing in periodicals while still studying at school.
                        Aleś Jakimovič, the editor of the &quot;Belarusian Pioneer&quot;, shared with him the addresses of other poets pioneers: this is how Julij Taŭbin became penpals with Siarhiej Hrahoŭski and Aleś Rozna.
                        In 1928 Julij Taŭbin entered the Mśćisłaŭ Pedagogical College, where he met Źmitrok Astapienka and Arkadź Kuliašoŭ. They soon became known as the &quot;Mśćisłaŭ Trinity&quot;. Together they wrote poems, and traveled to the Caucasus and Crimea.

                        Miensk
                        In 1931, after entering the Maksim Tank Pedagogical Institute, the &quot;Mśćisłaŭ Trinity&quot; moved to Miensk. There, friends rented a room on Rosa Luxemburg Street.
                        Julij Taŭbin joined BelAPP and was a member of TAVIZ together with Uladzimier Chadyka, Siarhiej Darožny, Valery Marakoŭ, Michaś Bahun, and others.
                        In the same year, Julij Taŭbin published two books: &quot;To live, sing and not grow old...&quot; and &quot;Three Poems&quot;. The year 1932 was no less productive for the poet: the books &quot;My Second Book&quot; and &quot;Taurida&quot; were published.

                        Arrest
                        On February 25, 1933, Julij Taŭbin was arrested, and on August 10 of the same year, he was sentenced to two years in exile. According to Valiancina Kuliašova, the reason was allegedly a letter from Taŭbin&apos;s aunt, who moved from Poland to the USA.
                        We know that in exile in Tyumen Julij Taŭbin worked in a theater as the head of the literary department.

                        Moscow
                        In 1935, after the exile, Julij Taŭbin moved to Moscow. He dreamed of publishing, but as an &quot;enemy of the nation&quot; got under censorship. Julij Taŭbin continued to translate poems.

                        Second arrest and death
                        In 1936, Julij Taŭbin was arrested again and transferred to Miensk.
                        We can imagine how the poet spent the last year of his life, based on protocols written by the NKVD investigators in 1938: representatives of the intelligentsia could be &quot;interrogated&quot; for three, five days without water, food, sleep, and even the opportunity to sit down, although the protocols were written in advance by investigators. The purpose of the torture was only to obtain the signatures of the accused under these protocols.
                        Julij Taŭbin was shot in the NKVD prison in Miensk on October 30, 1937, along with 131 other representatives of the Belarusian intelligentsia that night.
